                <p>Hello, my name is Eric. I studied Computer Systems Administration at Southern Adventist University. During school, I found that I have a fondness towards web development, database management, and pretending to be a hacker in Linux.</p>

                <p>Prior to school I was in the United States Air Force for 7 years. During my military stint, I was an A-10 mechanic for 4 years, a Signals Intelligence Analyst(hush hush) for 2 years, and my final year I worked for the Honor Guard.</p>

                <p>I enjoy working in a laidback environment with team members that enjoy each other's company. Some of my hobbies include mountain biking, watching football and basketball, and playing boardgames.</p>
